@0  = ~[Brage](sigh) Seeing these curious children asking all those questions gives me a pain in the heart... How I would long to have my girls with me and explain to them the legend of the well ghost...~
@1  = ~[Imoen]You wouldn't have done that, anyway!~
@2  = ~[Brage]Imoen! How can you say that - yes, I was working overtime, but I *did* take the girls on trips as well... Although maybe not as often as I'd wish!~
@3  = ~[Imoen]This is *Baldur's Gate*! You are from *Amn*! No way you would have taken your daughters into the Seatower for an afternoon leasure time.~
@4  = ~[Brage]Oh - you meant I wouldn't have taken them *here* because of the political tensions, especially as a commander of the Amnian guard... I'm sorry I snapped at you, Imoen. I thought you were referring to -~ 
@5  = ~[Imoen]That you are an old fart who took duty over his family anytime, expecting them to get along fine on their own and be always happy when they see you?~
@6  = ~[Brage]...Exactly. Now that you actually said it - it doesn't sound as infuriating as I imagined. It's just true. (sigh).~
@7  = ~[Brage]Ah well... I can't see my girls anymore, but I can see to other children growing up without fear and violence!~
@8  = ~[Brage]*Now* I learn about this?! Well, better late than never, I guess.~

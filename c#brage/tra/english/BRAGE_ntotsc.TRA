@0 = ~[Brage]You - you would have been under mind control and forced to do the cruel deeds you did?! I can't tell you how much I feel with you if that is indeed the case - in more ways than you might think.~
@1 = ~[Brage]I can see the shock of realization in your eyes, and the horror about what these hands of yours did. I... I went through the same as you. I remember when I was where you are now...~
@2 = ~[Brage]Do not lose yourself in despair and hopelessness. You need to repent! Pray for your god's mercy and live the rest of your life to make up for what you did, so something good might come out of it in the end!~
@3 = ~I... I will try... but how I do not know.~

@0  = ~[Brage]Imoen! That was a rather dangerous undertaking. Magic is not a toy! What were you thinking?~
@1  = ~[Imoen]But... but I created this beautiful tome... Aw, your tone is killing the fun, Brage. Look at how shiny it looks!~
@2  = ~[Brage]So you were considering nothing and just casting magic like you would throw a pebble into a pond? Just like a pebble stirs the waters, magic might stir *anything* - unwanted and dangerous - if you don't know what you are doing!~
@3  = ~[Imoen]Aw... Why are you so agitated? I just played a little... - Are you scared? You were scared!~
@4  = ~[Brage]Magic is dangerous if not handled reasonably, Imoen. I - I'm fond of your joyfulness, but *magic* is not the right place to "play a little". I fear for your safety. And ours, if I'm honest.~
@5  = ~[Imoen]Alright, I won't be reckless with it. I promise! Yes, sir! Got 'cha. Little Imoen didn't plan on frightening anyone with her attempts in magic.~
@6  = ~[Brage]I know you mean it - now, so I thank you. Please, stay away from it until you have a teacher who can restrain any unwanted effects in the future. Magic is *not* a toy... and it is never to be taken lightly.~

@0  = ~[Brage]What - what *blasphemy* is this? *You* would have found a way to turn around the natural order of arcane and divine magic, to grant live in flesh and blood and sane mind whithout the help of the gods? I would laugh at you, would the pain of mourning not choke my throat! Losing a loved one - loved ones - is a hard and cruel fate. Who are you to make such fun of the hopes and wishes of mourning people?!~
@1  = ~[Sylar]Ho there - I do not mean any disrespect with my studies. On the contrary!~
@2  = ~[Brage]Another necromancer tinkering with the *blasphemy* of resurrecting people without the help of divine powers! We already met one - here in the city, no less - who thought he could play god and give life - only by taking another for it, of course! We can tell you how this ends. You will find that it needs dark, very dark magic to accomplish what you desire, and you will probably destroy more than you will be able to save!~
@3  = ~[Sylar]It is well possible that the outcome will not be satisfactory, forcing me to stop my research. As it stands, the formular I found seems solid enough, all I'd need is some help to proof the concept.~

@0  = ~[Brage]Nashkel is in your debt, Master Taerom. Although the ore is needed everywhere, it *is* a mine on Amnish soil. I cannot thank you enough for looking into solving this and giving no heed to the tension between Amn and the Sword Coast.~
@1  = ~[Taerom]This problem goes far beyond national borders. The brittle ore also affects my profession to a not insignificant degree.~
@2  = ~[Brage]As the former commander of Nashkel I thank you deeply for looking into this, Master Thalantyr.~
@3  = ~[Thalantyr]I have some interest in seeing this problem solved myself. If only to stop the increase in not only adventurers but also ordinary people looking for magic-enhanced equipment on my doorstep.~

@350  = ~[Taerom]t was a poison, so to say, so we developped a kind of antidote. It should work without further arcane knowledge.~
